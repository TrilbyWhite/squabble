# SQUABBLE

An interactive word-puzzle board game with AI opponent.

The "share" directory has sample configurations, but you may want to create your own files based on the instructions in "note" in order to match preferences for the board layout.  Squabble will soon read these files first from ~/.config/squabble/{dict,tiles,bonus} to allow for easier customization.

### CONTROLS

- Move tiles with the mouse
- Hit enter to complete a play
- Press 'q' at anytime to quit

### TODO

- Sporadic segfault ??
- When tiles run out, rack is dumped ... no end to game yet
- Allow user to trade tiles (need to shuffle before replacement)
- Add "wildcard" tiles
- Add config dir for bonuses, tiles, and dictionary
- Add rc file for difficulty settings
- Allow use of user name
- Give names to AI difficulty levels?
- Allow adds and removes from (user) dictionary
	- Requires writing of dictionary on close

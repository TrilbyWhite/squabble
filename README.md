# SQUABBLE

An interactive word-puzzle board game with AI opponent.

The computer player AI is very nearly complete, but the game play interface is limited.

The "share" directory has sample configurations, but you may want to create your own files based on the instructions in "note" in order to match preferences for the board layout.
